# Little Shino and Common factors
Little Shino loves maths. Today her teacher gave her two intergers.  Shino is now wondering how many integers can divide both the numbers. She is busy with her assignments. Help her to solve the problem. 

## Output Format:
Print the **number of common factors** of *a* and *b*.

## Input Constraints:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1\leq&space;a,b&space;\leq&space;10^{12}" title="1\leq a,b \leq 10^{12}" />

## Sample:
> Input : <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$10&space;$15" title="$10 $15" /><br><br>
> Output : <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2" title="2" />

## Explanation:
